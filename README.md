Python Challenge

This was a two-part assignment to develop Python scripting skills for a couple of real-world situations involving analsyis of the financial records of a company ("PyBank") and modernizing the vote-counting process for a small, rural town ("PyPoll").

Provided for each part was a CSV file. Using the one provided for PyBank, I wrote a Python script to calculate the following:
  - Total number of months contained in the dataset
  - Net total mount of profits/losses for the period given
  - Changes in the profits/losses through the subject period
  - Amount of greatest increase in profits/losses (along with date) for the period
  - Amount of greatest decrease in profits/losses (along with date) for the period

Those results were then successfully exported to a text file.

Likewise, for PyPoll, I wrote a Python script to determine the following:
  - Total number of votes cast
  - Complete list of candidates who received votes
  - Percentage of votes each candidate received
  - Total number of votes received by each candidate
  - Winner among the candidates based on popular vote

Those results were also then successfully exported to a text file.
